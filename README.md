# Automation Script for Pentesters

The Automation Script for Pentesters is a PowerShell script that automates common tasks performed by penetration testers. It provides functionality for scanning open ports, enumerating services, and brute-forcing passwords, making the work of penetration testers more efficient and streamlined.

## Features
